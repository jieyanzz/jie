Lily of the Valley

In a world full of thorny roses,
She is a lily of the valley
Even in her darkest days,
She gleams with beauty 
Even when the world weighs her down
She keeps her hope and faith to never drown

A woman of God, a proof of his existence,
Please never change, always pray, 
Always love, always be kind,  
Always be hopeful, always be patient,
Always remain who you are, and fight the obstacles in life with persistence
